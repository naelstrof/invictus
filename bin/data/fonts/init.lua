-- TODO: Make lua check which language it is using and select an appropriate font for each.
-- Right now dotum doesn't support russian, but supports japanese.
-- While freesans doesn't support japanese, but supports russian.

-- Pick your poison:
addFont( "gui", "data/fonts/dotum.ttf" );
-- addFont( "gui", "data/fonts/freesans.ttf" );
